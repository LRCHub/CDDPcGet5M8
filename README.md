[00:31.09] Been meaning to tell you
[00:34.23] What's on my mind
[00:39.22] I must've thought about it
[00:42.67] A thousand times
[00:50.67] 
[00:47.12] Yeah we've been talking
[00:50.13] For some time now
[00:54.34] So why don't we see what this could be about
[01:01.13] I don't know
[01:07.13] 
[01:06.19] Think it's time you should let
[01:11.10] Let me see
[01:15.19] What this love
[01:18.27] Could really be
[01:23.16] Give it time you say
[01:26.83] Baby you know I'll be waiting
[01:37.84] I don't give you your time
[01:50.84] 
[01:45.34] You know that I'm always there
[01:48.82] To treat you right
[01:53.87] You made me feel special through the days and nights
[02:01.58] I thought that you'd be the one
[02:04.80] To hold me down
[02:09.54] But I found out you've
[02:12.80] Been messing around
[02:22.30] 
[02:17.47] Now I see
[02:22.56] That you're not meant for me (that you're not meant for me)
[02:27.27] You should go (you should go)
[02:30.77] Go ahead and leave me
[02:34.13] All alone (all alone)
[02:39.10] Oh I gave you time
[02:43.43] And you wasted mine
[02:53.40] So now what do I do
[03:02.90] 
[03:02.52] (You know that) I'd always wait for you
[03:10.93] I thought you'd be here too
[03:18.04] I'd always wait for you
[03:26.44] I thought you'd be here too
